# H2 Plan-Execute Boundary Eval — Grounded Candidate Inventory

> **Status**: Working document for FEATURE_107 P1.5 redo. Replaces the speculative `cases.ts` from commit 165fc0d.
>
> **Purpose**: Catalogue every reasonable H2 candidate from three KodaX-internal sources (unimplemented planned features, open issues, completed features) with **explicit, identical criteria** for inclusion. Output is reviewed before final dataset selection.

## Selection criteria (applied uniformly to every candidate)

A candidate qualifies as `H2 ✓` iff it satisfies all four:

| Criterion | Pass when |
|---|---|
| **Multi-file** | Requires modifying ≥3 files **OR** creating new module spanning ≥2 packages |
| **Bounded scope** | Completable in single session — not multi-version sprawling |
| **Has acceptance** | Design doc or issue description gives clear pass/fail signal |
| **Reproducible** | Pre-task SHA + repo state can be checked out (`git cat-file -e <sha>`) |

Rating:
- `✓` — meets all 4
- `?` — meets 3/4, requires P1.5 review
- `✗` — fails ≥2, exclude

Below, when a row is `✗` or `?`, the **specific failed criterion** is named (not a vague verdict). This is the protection against gut-feel filtering.

---

## Pool 1: Unimplemented Planned Features (post-v0.7.31)

KodaX shipped v0.7.31; features planned for v0.7.32+ are genuinely unimplemented. SHA = HEAD (current) since these would be implemented forward from now.

| ID | Title | v# | Multi-file? | Bounded? | Has AC? | Repro? | Verdict | Failure / Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 090 | Self-Modifying Role Spec (Tier 4) | v0.7.32 | ✓ ≥5 files in `coding/construction/` + tests + audit log | ✓ — single feature | ✓ — `v0.7.32.md` lists 5 reflexive safeguards as AC | ✓ HEAD | **✓** | strong candidate |
| 092 | Auto Mode Classifier (LLM-reviewed) | v0.7.33 | ✓ — guardrail wiring + policy gate + classifier provider | ✓ | ✓ — `v0.7.33.md` per design | ✓ HEAD | **✓** | depends on 085 (shipped); risk of conflating with 085 |
| 097 | AMA Realtime Todo List | v0.7.34 | ✓ — TodoListSurface + onTodoUpdate + tool registration | ✓ | ✓ — has component spec | ✓ HEAD | **✓** | UI-heavy; cross-package (coding + repl) |
| 094 | Anti-Escape Hardening | v0.7.36 | ✓ — guardrail + retry contract + tests | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ HEAD | **✓** | similar safeguard genre to 092 |
| 102 | Multi-Provider Orchestration Runtime | v0.7.45 | ✓ — telemetry + routing + fallback (4 phases) | **✗ multi-version** (4 phases per design) | partial | ✓ HEAD | **✗** | Bounded fails — sprawling 4-phase delivery |
| 105 | Verifiable Advisor Consult | v0.7.46 | ✓ — primitive + tracing + 4-field verdict | ? — Phase 1 alone is bounded; full feature is 3 phases | ✓ for Phase 1 | ✓ HEAD | **?** | Use **Phase 1 primitive only** as scope |
| 093 | Coding↔REPL Circular Dep Decoupling | v0.8.0 | ✓ — touches both packages structurally | ? — depends how deep (could be mechanical or architectural) | partial | ✓ HEAD | **?** | needs design-doc check on bounded |
| 007 | Theme System Consolidation | v0.8.0 | ? — likely mostly repl package | ✓ | ? | ✓ HEAD | **?** | Multi-file uncertain |
| 030 | Multi-Surface Delivery | v0.8.0 | ✓ — packaging + binaries + IDE-extension | **✗ multi-version sprawling** | ✗ | ✓ HEAD | **✗** | Bounded fails |
| 057-Track F | Cell-level diff renderer | in-flight | ✓ — substrate/ink rewrite | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ HEAD | **✓** | currently in-progress; replay risks colliding with active work |
| 060 | Bounded-Memory Runtime | v0.7.30 | ✓ | ? | ✓ | ✓ HEAD | **?** | Status unclear post v0.7.30 release |

**Pool 1 verdict counts**: ✓ = 5, ? = 4, ✗ = 2. Subtotal viable: **5 strong + 4 borderline = 9**.

## Pool 2: Open Issues (24 entries, excluding won't-fix #126)

From [`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md). All status=Open. SHA = HEAD (issue still exists).

**Pool 2 verdict counts**: ✓ = 11, ? = 4, ✗ = 9. Subtotal viable: **11 strong + 4 borderline = 15**.

---

## Pool 3: Completed Features (sample, NOT exhaustive)

80 completed features total. Exhaustive analysis is overkill — sample chosen to cover:
- Recent (v0.7.x) — easier git archaeology
- Different categories (refactor / new-feature / cross-cutting)
- Different scopes

Selected sample (10 entries) — others can be added in P1.5 if coverage matrix shows gaps:

| ID | Title | Released | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 046 | AMA Handoff Integrity (artifact-backed) | v0.7.x | new-feature, cross-pkg | Has design + acceptance criteria; impl commit identifiable |
| 047 | Invisible Adaptive Parallelism | v0.7.x | new-feature, cross-cutting | Tactical fan-out infra |
| 052 | Dual-Profile AMA Harness | v0.7.x | new-feature, cross-cutting | SA/AMA boundary |
| 061 | Scout-First AMA Architecture Simplification | v0.7.16 | refactor (massive) | The very thing FEATURE_107 is testing — meta but valid |
| 062 | Managed Task Budget Simplification | v0.7.16 | refactor, single-pkg | Bounded; clear pre/post |
| 072 | Lineage-Native Compaction | v0.7.x | refactor, cross-cutting | Compaction subsystem rewrite |
| 076 | Round-Boundary Message Shape | v0.7.x | refactor, single-pkg | Bounded scope |
| 084 | Layer A Agent/Handoff/Runner Adoption | v0.7.26 | refactor (large) | May be too sprawling — verify in P1.5 |
| 085 | Guardrail Runtime | v0.7.26 | new-feature, cross-cutting | Bounded primitive |
| 100 | SA Runner Frame Adoption | v0.7.29 | refactor (large) | Listed Critical priority; multi-phase per design — may fail bounded |

Each requires P1.5 work to:
1. Find exact impl commit SHA via `git log --all --grep "FEATURE_NNN"`
2. Capture parent SHA → pre-feature state
3. Run `git show <impl-sha> --stat` → ground-truth files-changed
4. Cross-reference with design doc acceptance criteria

**Pool 3 status**: 10 sampled, none deeply verified yet. Estimated 60% will pass bounded check → 6 viable. P1.5 to verify.

---

## Coverage matrix (Source × Type, with viable counts)

Using only `✓` candidates (P1.5 review may promote `?` → `✓`):

|                   | new-feature | refactor | bug-fix / quality-fix | cross-cutting | row total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Planned**       | 097, 057-F  | (none ✓) | 094 (anti-escape)     | 090, 092      | **5** |
| **Open Issues**   | 109, 110, 112, 108, 118 | 107 | 105, 106, 119, 124 | (none clean ✓) | **11** |
| **Completed**     | 046, 047, 085 | 062, 076 | (none of sample) | 052, 072 | **~6** (after P1.5 verify) |
| **column total**  | **9** | **3** | **5** | **5** | **22 viable** |

### Coverage gap analysis

- **Refactor cell underpopulated** in Planned and Completed-sample. Mitigation: include 107 (rename refactor) from Issues; consider 062/076 from Completed; if still thin, mine more Completed features tagged "refactor" in design docs.
- **Bug-fix in Completed**: zero in sample because most bugs go to KNOWN_ISSUES.md, not FEATURE_LIST.md. This is an inherent skew — bug-fix coverage relies on Open Issues (which is fine, that's what they're for).
- **Cross-cutting in Open Issues**: zero clean ✓. Most cross-cutting Open issues fail bounded (092 team mode, 091 first-class tooling, 094 file-too-big family). Mitigation: rely on Planned (090, 092) and Completed (052, 072) for cross-cutting.

### Distribution check

If we pick **18 final cases** with target ~4-5 per type column (9+3+5+5 = 22 candidates → pick 18):
- new-feature: 4-5 cases (subset of 9 candidates)
- refactor: 3 cases (all 3 candidates, possibly add 1 more)
- bug-fix: 4-5 cases (subset of 5)
- cross-cutting: 4-5 cases (subset of 5)

This is balanced and **does not require fabricating any case**.

---

## What this inventory does NOT cover

- **Plan-complexity dimension** (linear / branching / iterative): not yet tagged per candidate. Would need design-doc deep read for each.
- **Existing-code-dependency dimension** (greenfield / extension / modification): not yet tagged. Mostly trivial post-design-read.
- **Subjective quality of "user prompt"**: each picked case will need a userMessage authored. The userMessage should paraphrase the issue/feature description, NOT be invented.

These secondary dimensions become relevant in P1.5 selection, not for the viable/non-viable filter.

---

## Process from here (proposed)

1. **You review this inventory** — challenge any rating, especially `?` rows where I marked criteria as uncertain
2. **You signal which Pool sources to prioritize** — e.g., "issues over completed" or "include all of Pool 1 ✓"
3. **I do P1.5 verification for the picks**:
   - Each case: read design doc / issue detail in full; lock acceptance criteria
   - Each Completed case: identify impl commit + parent SHA + files changed
   - Author userMessage from source material (no invention)
   - Resolve `?` ratings to `✓` or `✗`
4. **Output**: rewritten `cases.ts` replacing the 165fc0d speculative version

**No code changes** until step 4. This document + your sign-off is the gate.

---

## Honest caveats about this inventory

- **Multi-file column is preliminary**: I tagged based on issue title + design-doc skim, not full file-path enumeration. P1.5 will lock this.
- **Bounded column relies on design-doc claims**: some "✓ bounded" features may turn out larger when implementing — but at design-time-truth they are bounded, which is what eval needs.
- **Has-AC column is "can I find a pass criterion"**, not "criteria are unambiguous". P1.5 may downgrade some `✓` → `?` if criteria turn out to be narrative without verifiable assertion.
- **My ratings can be wrong**: this artifact is for you to overrule. Each row's failure reason is named so you can verify or challenge it.

---

## P1.5 verification of `?` rows (deep-check after design doc / issue detail read)

Each ? row got resolved by reading the design doc / issue detail in full.

| ID | Source | Original ? | Verification finding | New verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-105** | Planned (v0.7.46) | Phase 1 vs full feature ambiguous | Design explicitly scopes MVP to "tool 文件 + capability alias + 2 mode prompt 模板, < 800 LOC". Phase 1 is bounded; Phases 2/3 are post-MVP benchmark-driven. | **✓** (Phase 1 scope only) |
| **F-093** | Planned (v0.8.0) | Multi-file + bounded uncertain | Design doc reveals: FEATURE_082 (v0.7.24) **already cleared 49/50 cycles**. Only 1 cycle remains. Scope too small for H2. | **✗** (scope shrunk to near-trivial) |
| **F-007** | Planned (v0.8.0) | Multi-file + AC uncertain | Design has 4 explicit goals (replace hard-coded colors / theme persistence / `/theme` commands / cleanup legacy). Multi-file confirmed (`ThemeContext` + chalk migration + commands). | **✓** |
| **F-060** | Planned (v0.7.30) | Bounded uncertain | Design doc Status field: **"Completed (Tier 1 landed; profile-driven stretch goals deferred)"**. Already shipped — should not be in Planned pool. | **✗** (already completed) |
| **I-095** | Issue (Med) | Multi-file uncertain | Issue body: "Source Debt IDs H38-H44, M39" (7 debt items). "Sprawling code-quality debt" — not bounded. | **✗** (bounded fails) |
| **I-111** | Issue (Low) | AC uncertain | Issue body: only `transport.ts` test coverage; estimated 1-2 test files. **Too small for H2** — borderline H1/H0. | **✗** (multi-file fails) |
| **I-120** | Issue (High) | Multi-file uncertain | Issue body: "约 30 行集中在 InkREPL.tsx" — **single-file 30-line fix**. Bounded ✓ but multi-file ✗. | **✗** (multi-file fails) |
| **I-122** | Issue (Med) | Multi-file uncertain | **Issue is already fixed** at commit `4423e0d` (verified ancestor of HEAD). Doc lag — issue still marked Open in KNOWN_ISSUES.md but bug is gone. | **✗** (already resolved) |

### Updated viable counts after P1.5 verification

| Pool | Original ✓ | After verify | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Planned post-v0.7.31** | 5 | **6** | +1 (gained 105, 007; lost 060, 093) |
| **Open Issues** | 11 | **11** | 0 (all 4 ? resolved to ✗) |
| **Completed (sample)** | ~6 (estimated) | TBD | needs git archaeology |
| **Total viable** | 22 | **17 + ~6** | **~23** |

Picking 18 final cases is still feasible, though tighter than before.

### Updated coverage matrix (after verification)

|                   | new-feature | refactor | bug-fix / quality-fix | cross-cutting | row total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Planned**       | 097, 057-F, 105, 007 | (none ✓) | 094 | 090, 092 | **7** |
| **Open Issues**   | 109, 110, 112, 108, 118 | 107 | 105, 106, 119, 124 | (none clean ✓) | **11** |
| **Completed**     | 046, 047, 085 | 062, 076 | (none of sample) | 052, 072 | **~6** |
| **column total**  | **~12** | **3** | **5** | **5** | **~25 viable** |

## Self-audit of this framework (Q4 from user)

The user asked me to seriously challenge the framework I built, since they cannot independently evaluate it. Below is my honest critique of my own work, ordered by severity. Mitigations are noted but not all are actionable inside FEATURE_107 scope.

### A. The 4-criteria filter is my construct, not validated against any reference

I picked **multi-file / bounded / has-AC / reproducible** as the gates. I did not:
- Reference an external eval-design best-practice document
- Define why these 4 and not others (e.g., "agent-doable without external services" is missing)
- Validate the criteria against pilot eval runs

What I did do: chose criteria that would mechanically filter out clearly non-H2 cases. They work as a coarse filter but they're not principled.

**Mitigation possible**: Add "agent-doable" as a 5th criterion (no external auth/account/billing). May not change current verdicts.

**Mitigation NOT possible inside FEATURE_107 scope**: Validate criteria against external eval framework — would require pilot runs.

### B. Multi-file threshold ≥3 is arbitrary

I picked 3. Could be 2, could be 5. There is no principled choice.

If we tightened to ≥5, several Issue ✓ rows (109, 110) would become ✗ — they pass at 3 but fail at 5. The viable pool would shrink to ~18 from ~25.

**Mitigation**: Document the threshold explicitly with rationale "≥3 because 1-2 file tasks usually H1; ≥3 forces planning consideration." Acknowledge sensitivity.

### C. The `?` bucket was an escape hatch

8 ? rows let me defer hard calls in v1 of the inventory. The verification step closed them all — but a stricter upfront rubric would have produced better v1.

**Mitigation**: For future inventories, force binary ✓/✗ at v1 with explicit "needs-data" flags rather than ? bucket.

### D. Source × Type matrix bakes in an unproven assumption

The whole reason I structured by Source × Type is so that P5 analysis can slice eval results by category. **This presumes type-specific lossiness exists**. We don't know that.

If type doesn't matter, balancing by type is wasted effort and a random sample of viable H2 cases would be statistically cleaner.

**Mitigation**: Document the assumption. Run P5 analysis BOTH with and without type slicing. If type-slicing shows no differential, conclude "type doesn't matter for plan/execute lossiness" — that's also a valuable finding.

### E. Pool 3 sample is cherry-picked

I picked 10 "representative" Completed features by intuition. Not random, not exhaustive.

A truly random sample from 80 might give different distribution. An exhaustive scan (all 80 with the same filter) would be most defensible but costs 6+ hours.

**Mitigation**: Document sampling method. Acknowledge selection bias. If user wants fully random or exhaustive, they should ask.

### F. "Has AC" is my inference, not the source's gift

Many issues describe complaints, not specifications. I marked "has AC" when I could derive a pass/fail criterion from the description. **That criterion is mine**, not the issue author's.

This is a bias multiplier — agents will be evaluated against criteria I invented based on issues someone else wrote.

**Mitigation**: When authoring final cases.ts, lift acceptance criteria text VERBATIM from issue/design-doc where possible. Mark explicitly when I had to add inference.

### G. HEAD-anchored cases drift over time

Pool 1 (Planned) and Pool 2 (Issues) cases anchor SHA = HEAD. Eval runs today vs 6 months later differ.

**Mitigation**: Pin SHA to current HEAD at P1.5 time. Document "cases reproducible against SHA `<X>`; later SHAs may give different results."

### H. The whole exercise is solo work without external review

No second reviewer. No external eval-framework benchmark. I'm reasoning from first principles + Anthropic harness blog + Claude Code's Agent docs.

Could be missing standard eval-design wisdom that someone with experience would catch.

**Mitigation possible**: Send the inventory + framework to `codex-rescue` agent for an independent second-opinion review pass.

### I. The deepest critique: FEATURE_107 may be testing the wrong question

P1.0 scan showed: KodaX user (you) had **0 H2 sessions in 533**. Even if we get this eval right, the answer's real-world impact on your workflow is small.

Counter-argument I made earlier: "architectural value matters even if frequency is low." That's true but weak — we may be investing significant effort to answer a question whose answer doesn't change much in practice.

A more relevant question might be: "Why does H2 trigger so rarely? Is the threshold wrong?" — that's a totally different eval (about Scout's classification calibration, not plan/execute boundary).

**Mitigation NOT possible inside FEATURE_107 scope**: this would require restarting from FEATURE_107's framing question.

**Mitigation possible**: Frame eval results conservatively in P5 — "B vs A on synthetic+inferred H2 distribution; not validated against organic user H2 distribution because no organic H2 data exists."

### J. "Refactor" cell is structurally underpopulated

After verification, refactor cell has only 3 candidates (Issue 107 + Completed 062, 076). Even all-3-picked gives only 3 cases for refactor — too few for sub-category statistics.

**Mitigation**: Either (a) accept refactor as small-sample or (b) deliberately mine more refactor-class Completed features — would expand Pool 3 archaeology cost.

### K. The frame still trusts my judgment on non-? rows

I deep-checked the 8 ? rows. The 22 non-? rows (✓ or ✗) **were not deep-verified**. Some ✓ rows (e.g., I-119 Scout mutationSurface, I-124 dispatch trigger rate) may have hidden problems I didn't catch.

**Mitigation**: When authoring final cases.ts, do a P1.5b pass that deep-reads each picked candidate before locking. Find any disqualifiers before they pollute the dataset.

### Summary of what self-audit changes vs my original framework

| Concern | Magnitude | Actionable within FEATURE_107? |
|---|---|---|
| A — criteria validation | Medium | Add "agent-doable"; document choice |
| B — ≥3 threshold arbitrary | Low | Document + acknowledge sensitivity |
| C — ? bucket | Low | Already closed by verification |
| D — type-balanced sampling | **High** | Run P5 analysis without type slicing too |
| E — Pool 3 sampling | Medium | Document; let user request fuller scan |
| F — AC inference | Medium | Use verbatim text where possible |
| G — HEAD drift | Low | Pin SHA at P1.5 |
| H — solo work | Medium | Get codex-rescue second-opinion review |
| I — wrong question | **High** | Conservative P5 framing |
| J — refactor underpopulated | Medium | Accept small sample OR mine more |
| K — non-? rows not deep-checked | Medium | Add P1.5b deep-check pass |

### Things the self-audit does NOT solve

- I cannot make this framework "objectively correct"
- I can only make it **as defensible as a single agent's careful work allows**
- The user retaining final approval rights remains the primary safeguard against my errors

## Pool 3 archaeology — actual findings (replaces estimate)

Original estimate: ~6 viable Completed features. **Reality: 2-3.**

### Why the gap

`git log --all --grep="FEATURE_NNN"` shows **only 10 features** have ≥3 commits with explicit FEATURE-tag in commit messages:

```
52  FEATURE_100  (multi-phase SA Runner, sprawling)
14  FEATURE_086  (prefix cleanup hygiene)
13  FEATURE_084  (Layer A primitives, sprawling)
 8  FEATURE_107  (this feature — self-reference, exclude)
 4  FEATURE_104  (Prompt-Eval Harness)  ← clean
 3  FEATURE_101  (Admission Contract — bundled with 106 in 51ba874)
 3  FEATURE_098  (Per-Model Context Window) ← clean
 3  FEATURE_085  (Guardrail Runtime — bundled with 084 in edec529)
 3  FEATURE_077  (older Skills work)
 3  FEATURE_061  (mostly later evolution touches)
```

**The other ~70 completed features did not reference their FEATURE_NNN in commit messages** — typical KodaX commits use feature-area scope tags like `feat(coding):` or `refactor(repl):`. So git-archaeology via grep doesn't reach them.

### Per-candidate verdict (after archaeology)

| ID | First impl SHA (parent for replay) | Files changed | Clean? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-104** Prompt-Eval Harness | `c68ddee^` (parent of c68ddee) | 15 files: `benchmark/harness/*` + `benchmark/datasets/*` + docs + package.json | ✓ clean 4-commit chain | **✓** |
| **F-098** Per-Model Context Window | `dc7c38b^` (parent of dc7c38b) | ~10 files in `packages/ai/` + docs | ✓ clean coherent series | **✓** |
| **F-101** Admission Contract | `51ba874^` (parent) | sprawling: core + coding + benchmark + multiple datasets + 2 follow-up patches | bundled with FEATURE_106; cross-package broad | **?** scope too broad to be clean H2 case |
| **F-085** Guardrail Runtime | `edec529^` (parent) | bundled with FEATURE_084 in same commit; cannot cleanly extract just 085's diff | extraction fail | **?** bundle problem |

The 6 originally sampled but NOT in mineable list (046, 047, 052, 061, 062, 072, 076, 084) — drop from Pool 3.

### Updated viable count (final)

| Pool | Original ✓ | After all verification | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pool 1 (Planned post-v0.7.31) | 5 | **7** | +2 (105/007 promoted) |
| Pool 2 (Open Issues) | 11 | **10** | -1 (recount, unchanged after ?-verify) |
| Pool 3 (Completed) | ~6 estimate | **2** | -4 (most untraceable via grep) |
| **Total viable** | ~22 | **19** | -3 |

19 viable → can pick 18 with 1-case slack. Tight but feasible. Per FEATURE_107 doc's "dataset shortfall fallback" rule, this is in the "≥18" zone (no scaling needed).

### Pool 3 specific cases for cases.ts
